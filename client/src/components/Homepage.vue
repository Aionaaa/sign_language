    <p>British Sign Language (BSL) is a sign language used in the UK. There are different sign languages for different countries, even ones which use the same spoken language. There are 125,000 Deaf adults in the UK who use BSL, plus an estimated 20,000 children. Many of these people use BSL as their first language. BSL uses the hands, body, face, and head. Many hearing people also use BSL, such as interpreters and family members of Deaf people. <br><br>
